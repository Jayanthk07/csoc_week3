in this level after a long investigation here and there and also in cntrl+u i see a file named secret in the code, so i decided to click it , but it just gave me some extra part like this "view-source:http://saturn.picoctf.net:62417/secret/assets/index.css"
so i removed that assets/index.css part from that ,
now in that code i am able to see a file named hidden , 
so i decided to click it 
after clicking it , i got some extar thing in th path ,like this "view-source:http://saturn.picoctf.net:62417/secret/hidden/file.css" so i decided to remove this file.css part from the url , and go some code 
in which i can see a filenamed
