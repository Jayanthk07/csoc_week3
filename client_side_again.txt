CLIENT SIDE AGAIN:
so after a lot of search in cntrl + u , i see the javascript to be suspicious , so i decided to copy it and beuatify it and check it , so in that script i see a variable _0x4b5b being used repeatedly to compare anything for authentication 
so i decided to go through it , then i decided to check out for _0x4b5b(0x2) in the console which gave me "substring" which was useless , so i tried _0x4b5b(0x3), it gave picoCTF{ which seemed like teh answer , so i though to go forward
then i tried 0x4,0x5,0x6,0x7,0x8 which eventually gave me the parts of the flag and i though to stop at 0x8 as it gave me password verified

so showing the outputs by parts
_0x4b5b(0x2)
"substring"
_0x4b5b(0x3)
"picoCTF{"
_0x4b5b(0x4)
"not_this"
_0x4b5b(0x5)
"f49bf}"
_0x4b5b(0x6)
"_again_e"
_0x4b5b(0x7)
"this"
_0x4b5b('0x8')
"Password Verified" 


now after combining them to get the flag we get      picoCTF{not_this_again_ef49bf}
