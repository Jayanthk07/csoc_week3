so after opening this website it shows people using picobrowser can only acces this website, so i have to change the User-Agent header to manipulate it

User-Agent: PicoBrowser

now it appears like its using picobrowser

now it says users from other websites wont work , then i wrote the Referer header to make it look like it is from same website ,by making it same as host

Referer: mercury.picoctf.net:39114

now it says peopla from 2018 can only acces the website
so now i manipulate the Date header , aftet checking the format from the google

Date: Tue, 29 Oct 2018
