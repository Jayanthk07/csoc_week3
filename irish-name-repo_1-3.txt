after seeing this page i open the admin login page  where i have to login as admin 
so after experience from the web gauntlet , we try
username: ad'||'min
password: ' is not '.
we use ad'||'min as username bcuz admin is not to be enterd , and pasword creates a query such that in password thing becomes true by doing '' is not '.' which is true
so we get the flag as picoCTF{s0m3_SQL_f8adf3fb}
