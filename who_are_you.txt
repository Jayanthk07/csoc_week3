so after opening this website it shows people using picobrowser can only acces this website, so i have to change the User-Agent header to manipulate it

User-Agent: PicoBrowser

now it appears like its using picobrowser

now it says users from other websites wont work , then i wrote the Referer header to make it look like it is from same website ,by making it same as host

Referer: mercury.picoctf.net:39114

now it says peopla from 2018 can only acces the website
so now i manipulate the Date header , aftet checking the format from the google

Date: Tue, 29 Oct 2018 

now it says it dont trust trackble ones, so we now modify a special header named DNT, by setting it to 1 , this request politely asks the website to not to track, which was enough for this challenge

DNT:1

now it says we should be from sweden , so we take a swedish ip from the internet and keep it to the X-Forwarded-For header , which makes it look like from sweded , again its just a lite one ,some websites may block it 

X-Forwarded-For:102.177.146.0

now it says if ur from sweden then why r u not accepting swedish , which is done by modifying the Accept-Language header, from google we can see that the swedish one will be like sv-SE

Accept-Language: sv-SE,en;q=0.5

after these modifications , i got the flag picoCTF{http_h34d3rs_v3ry_c0Ol_much_w0w_20ace0e4}


the final request looks like this 

GET / HTTP/1.1
